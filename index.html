							<p>After being presented with four different briefs in order to do my 3D model, I settled on the environment
							due to the vast variety that I can base my model on. I discussed and set my ideas in a mind map that is showcased
							above; this is set up of all of the different environments that I could create.<br>For my environment though I
							decided that I would produce an old fashioned town centre or road, this would therefore be a cross section in a
							road.</br></p>

							<p>I watch a lot of video depicting different types of 2d animation that people made on YouTube. These videos
							gave me the thought on how to make my video and what the theme would be. I came across quite a few stickman fight
							videos and decided that the idea would fit the criteria of the assignment and would be relatively easy to complete
							while adding detail would increase it complexity to a boring 2d animation to a creative and imaginative creation
							that would eventually take place for people to watch and hopefully enjoy.</p>

								<h3>Game Creation</h3>
							</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="file://D:Year 2/Website Production/Zombies.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>My top down shooter game was a thought that I have being thinking of for a game design idea, that I thought
								would be appealing to age range of teenage boys and some girls that enjoy the aspect of these sorts of games.
								The game template will be based around certain movies such as Zombieland, Cockneys vs Zombies and Shaun of the
								Dead, where they are based primarily on the fact of a group of people against a zombie apocalypse. This game will
								however only be about one person against some zombies, where his weapons consist of a gun and a possible use of a
								grenade. The look of the game will be quite dark and menacing, while contrasting with the look and feel of the
								character that surround the background, with their somewhat colourful and fun loving appearance, giving the whole
								eerie feeling a positive twist on the circumstance that the player is faced with.</p>

							<p>The game that I have thought of would have to be a franchised intellectual property due to the fact that I do not have
							the proper capital to make it and also because I want to use a map with street view to be able to race on. In order to get
							proper funds, I will have to have to sell the idea of the game to Google Maps; this will also help with the use of their
							maps and street view.<br>This is not your average racing game with pre-designed maps and races. This is a 21st century
							revolutionary racing game which incorporates the use of Google Maps to create a unique never seen before game play. One way
							in which it has a twist on regular racing games is the fact that in order to begin game play, you need to make a custom built
							track to race on.</br></p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<img src="file://D:Year 2/Website Production/Mums IPhone 5c 403.png"><p style="text-align:left">
							My name is Fabiana Lombardi, I am 19 years old and I am currently studying at Harrogate College after graduating from Ripon
							Grammar School after finishing my Lower Sixth Form Year. At the moment I am studying a BTEC Level 3 in IT nd hope to continue
							on to University to start a degree reading Computer Science. While at Ripon Grammar School, I completed my GCSEs in Maths, English,
							Science and French as well as many more (9 in total), all ranging from A-C. I also completed an AS Level in Maths. </br>In fourth
							year of my high	school education, I undertook work experience with BackUp Technologies who provide technical support for computer
							systems all around the world including some major companies such as BBC. This is where I wrote my first digital blog, which was
							inserted into their newsletter, about the introduction and development of Google Glasses. This type of experience in the IT industry
							has only furthered my decision to study computer science. It has also increased my knowledge of different types of computer systems
							such as Linux and Mac OS as well as coding software’s.</br></br>Most of my outer college learning for this subject has come from the
							internet through the website FutureLearn gaining qualifications in Cyber Security, Digital Marketing, Web Science, Data to Insight and
							also the Basics in Java Programming. When participating in the programming course I encountered the basic instructions to create a
							simplistic mobile game, while also gathering certificates to signify that I had completed the courses to the required specifications.
							I have found these highly stimulating and enriching to my education, giving me a more valuable experience enabling me to get on the path
							in which I would like to follow.</br></br>My love of problem solving has become a major factor with my work at Decon Solutions as I am
							undertaking situations I have never encountered before and after completing each problem, it gives me an increased sense of enlightenment
							after realising that every problem has a solution. This also leaves me with a great anticipation for the next problem that needs to be
							solved. I have also embarked on producing an easy to use financial worksheet in order to calculate their VAT for each expenditure and
							transaction made, therefore resulting in a simple and time efficient format.</br></br>My class was elected to represent Harrogate College
							for an anti-cyber bullying campaign which involved producing a video to be shown on YouTube, which later won an award for the best
							creativity out of the entire Hull group of colleges. This helped develop my teamwork and responsibilities to help shed light on an
							overlooked sensitive topic.</br></br>My interests span further than that of computers. I am a keen boxer and enjoy participating in a
							local boxing group. I first decided that I was interested in boxing when I wanted to find a fun way in which I could increase my fitness
							and be able to unwind from the stress of college and school. Overall I have managed to increase my agility and coordination by taking part
							in different activities and sparring with others in a controlled environment showing that I am competitive and focused.</br></br>What
							excites me the most about computer science is the fact that we have only just begun to scratch the surface of their limitless capabilities.
							I am looking forward to becoming part of the next female generation of computer scientists to bring forward new attributes and build on
							the work of today’s greatest minds.</p></div>
